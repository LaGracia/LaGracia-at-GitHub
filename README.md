Welcome to my web showcase.
===========================
This is a record of my completed projects for the Udacity Front-End Web Development nanodegree. Projects that contain personal information may be listed here but not linked.

Credits

Having absolutely zero programming background, I copy shamelessly from the work of students who have completed their projects and share their repositories on GitHub. Many thanks to all of them! Once my projects meet the code reviewers' expectations, I will pay it forward by sharing my work too, in case someone can learn from it. As they say …
